Manager for playlists files, Autoplaylists and UI-only playlists. 
Shows a virtual list of all playlists [and] files within a configured
tracked folder. After loading it on a panel, set the tracked folder
using the menu at header: 'Set playlists folder...'.

For example: (that's a folder within my foobar profile)
	C:\Users\XXX\AppData\Roaming\foobar2000\playlist_manager\...
Autoplaylist json files are stored in your foobar profile folder:
	.\js_data\...

Multiple panels are allowed but usually 2 panels should not point to
the same tracked folder, unless auto-saving is disabled on one of them,
otherwise there could be conflicts accessing to the same file.

Playlists are saved with (tracks) absolute paths by default, you can 
change that behavior on the menus. When using relative paths, the tracks'
folders should be in the same path than the tracked folder. i.e.:
	Tracked Folder: Z:\My music\
	Music Folders: Z:\My music\CDs, Z:\My music\DVDs\, ...

Finally, you can import another Autoplaylist data file by this script or 
Auto-playlist Manager by marc2003 using the contextual menu.

For a full list of features, take a look at the PDF manual.

Note: left shift + left windows key + right mouse click will open default 
Spider Monkey Panel context menu to edit the panel.
