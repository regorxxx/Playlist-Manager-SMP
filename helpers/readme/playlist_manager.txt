Manager for playlists files, AutoPlaylists and UI-only playlists.
Shows a virtual list of all playlists [and] files within a configured
tracked folder. Once loaded on a panel, set the tracked folder using
the menu at header: 'Set playlists folder...'.

For example: (that's a folder within my foobar profile)
	C:\Users\XXX\AppData\Roaming\foobar2000\playlist_manager\...
AutoPlaylist json files are stored in your foobar profile folder:
	[foobar profile]\js_data\...

Multiple panels are allowed but usually 2 panels should not point to
the same tracked folder, unless auto-saving and auto-backups are
disabled on one of them, otherwise there could be conflicts accessing
to the same files.

Playlists are saved with [tracks'] absolute paths by default, you can
change that behavior on the menus. When using relative paths, the tracks'
folders should be in the same path than the tracked folder. i.e.:
	Tracked Folder: Z:\My music\
	Music Folders: Z:\My music\CDs, Z:\My music\DVDs\, ...

You can import another AutoPlaylists data file by this script or
Auto-playlist Manager sample by marc2003 using the menus.

Note the manager is meant to be primarily used for items tracked on
library. If you don't use foobar2000's media library or add external
items to playlists, there will be a speed penalty loading them.

Note: Shift + Windows + R. Click will open Spider Monkey Panel
or JSplitter context menu to manage the panel.
