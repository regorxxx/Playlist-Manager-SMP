Manager for offline playlists. Shows a virtual list of all playlists files within a configured folder (PlaylistPath).
After loading it on a panel, set a tracked folder using the appropriate menu or check the panel properties. 
For example: (that's a folder within my foobar profile)
	C:\Users\XXX\AppData\Roaming\foobar2000\playlist_manager\server\
Autoplaylist json files are stored in your profile folder:
	foobar2000\js_data\
	
Playlists are saved with (tracks) absolute paths by default, you can change that behavior on the menus. 
When using relative paths, the tracks' folders should be in the same path than the tracked folder. i.e.:
	Tracked Folder: Z:\My music\
	Music Folders: Z:\My music\CDs, Z:\My music\DVDs\, ...

Finally, you can import another Autoplaylist data file by this script or Auto-playlist Manager by marc2003 using the contextual menu.
Note: left shift + left windows key + right mouse click will open default context menu.

Features:
	 Manages Playlist files and AutoPlaylists.	-
		- Playlist files are linked to physical files (.m3u8, .m3u, .pls or .fpl).
		- AutoPlaylists are saved into json format.
		- All playlist are loaded in cache once, filtering just changes the "painted" playlist on the list.
		- Paths within the playlist may be absolute or relative to a folder (configurable).
	 AutoPlaylists: contains all functionality on Auto-playlist Manager by marc2003 plus more.
		- Create, rename, delete AutoPlaylists.
		- Edit query, sort pattern and sort forcing.
		- Adds tooltip info, UI features, filters, etc.
		- Number of tracks output is updated at foobar startup. (and/or 'at manual refresh')
		- Queries and sort patterns are checked for validity before using them, instead of crashing.
	 Loads .m3u8, .m3u and .pls playlists x100 times faster than standard foobar (if all items are on library). i.e. "As fast as the native format".
	 Auto-saves changes within foobar to bound playlists files. (configurable)
	 Automatically updates changes within the tracked folder. (configurable)
	 New updates are delayed when performing internal updates/processing to avoid conflicts.
	 Bind playlist to files:
		- Tracks playlists for changes and update bound files.
		- Auto-saving (configurable).
		- Deleting the file also ask to delete the bound playlist.
		- Renaming the files also renames the bound playlist.
		- Show bound playlist (becomes active playlist).
	 Lock/unlock playlists (so they are read-only).
		- Automatically locking of native foobar playlists files (.fpl). (configurable)
		- When locked, playlists can not be updated nor edited. They can be deleted.
		- Filename can be changed, but not playlist name (inside the file). This allows to set different playlist and file names if required.
	 Playlist unique IDs. You can have multiple playlists with same name on the UI and bound to different files. (configurable)
		- If changing UUIDs config while having playlists already loaded, then new config will be used whenever they get updated.
		- You can manually force new UUID config just by renaming the files.
	 Show playlist size on the list. (some limits apply for .fpl playlist files (*)) (configurable)
		- All (refresh AutoPlaylists queries)
		- Only standard playlist
		- No size
	 If you choose not to refresh AutoPlaylists sizes, then the first calculated size gets used: when imported from json or creating the AutoPlaylist.
	 Playlist Tags and actions: 
		- Playlists may be tagged with 'bAutoLoad', 'bAutoLock' or a custom set of tags (for arbitrary purposes).
		- Auto-Functions: automatically applies some actions whenever a playlist is loaded on the panel according to the tags present on it. 
		 'bAutoLoad' makes the playlist to be loaded within foobar automatically (on the UI). Meant to be used on remote servers with online controllers.
		 'bAutoLock' locks the playlist as soon as it's loaded on the panel.
	 Track Auto-tagging: add tag values automatically to any track added on playlist.
		- Can be configured separately for standard playlists, Autoplaylists, locked playlists and individual playlists.
		- Standard playlists may be used to easily tag your library just by sending them to the right playlist (which don't need to be loaded at all).
		- Autoplaylists Auto-tagging allows to automatically (and periodically) apply some tagging logic to the current library following some condition.
		- Multiple playlists may be used as pools, using a final Autoplaylist which checks for an specific added tag (by other playlists -aka pools-).
		- Allows multiple inputs:
		 TF expressions (or %tags%).
		 JavaScript functions (defined at 'helpers_xxx_utils.js').
		 Value (string or number).
	 Tooltips show different playlist info:
		- Header with filters, categories and total number of playlists.
		- Playlists:
		 Name plus UUID.
		 Playlist size (tracks). Also for AutoPlaylists (the number of tracks output by the query).
		 Category / Tag(s).
		 Track Tag(s).
		 Status (lock).
		 Query. Sort Pattern. (AutoPlaylists)
	 Cyclic filters:
		- Show All | Only Autoplaylists | Only Playlists
		- Show All | Not locked | Only locked
	 Cyclic Sorting:
		- Name: Az | Za
		- Size: Ascd. | Desc.
		- Category: Az | Za
	 UUIDs: added to the name, so they are separated from non tracked playlist by name when loaded in foobar. Some also allow some level of names duplication.
		- Invisible Unicode chars plus (*)
		- (a-f)
		- (*) 
		- Or none
	 Category filters: playlist may be filtered by category (like virtual folders), multiple selection allowed in a menu.
		- When lists are being filtered by category, an indicator is shown in the header text.
	 Additional tools for playlists:
		- Check for dead items on playlists files (without having to load them on foobar!).
		- Check for playlists with mixed relative and absolute paths.
		- Check for playlists with items not present on library.
	 3 different writable formats. (some limits apply for .pls playlist files (**)) (configurable)
	 Filter (configurable) and sorting gets saved between reloads.
	 RecycleBin: deleting and restoring.
		- Uses timestamps to uniquely identify files: no collisions with other files within the RecycleBin.
	 A backup of the previous playlist json file is created every time the panel is loaded. Old backups are sent to recycle bin.
	 Properties descriptions change according to things set on the panel, not just the values. i.e. if you change the sort method, then the description reflects the associated states dynamically.
	 UI:
		- UI resizable on the fly.
		- Selection indicators.
		- Now playing and loaded playlist indicators.
		- Empty / not empty playlist indicators. To be used as fallback when size is not shown.
		- Font Size (configurable).
		- Separators between different names/categories (configurable).
		- Colors for different playlists types, status, text, background and selection (configurable).
	 Shortcuts:
		- Double Click: Load playlist / Make bound playlist active
		- Left Click: playlist contextual menu
		- Right Click: panel menu
		- Ctrl + Left Click: Load playlist / Make bound playlist active
		- Shift + Left Click: Send current selection to playlist
		- Ctrl + Shift + Left Click: Delete playlist
	 Other scripts integration:
		- [Playlist-Tools-SMP](https://github.com/regorxxx/Playlist-Tools-SMP): Pools may use tracks from playlists files tracked by the manager, not requiring to have playlists loaded within foobar. i.e. Random Pools component-like playlist creation, using not only queries as sources, but also other playlists or playlists files.

(*)	.fpl playlists are non writable, but size and other data (UUID, category, lock status or tags) may be cached between sessions as soon as it's set for the first time.
(**) .pls playlists format doesn't allow extra data like UUID, category, lock status or tags, ... use .m3u or .m3u8 for full data support.
