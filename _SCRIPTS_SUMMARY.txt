INFO:
-----
This is general info for all the scripts. Within all files you will find 6 [+] big scripts: Playlist
Manager, Timeline, World Map, Not a Waveform Seekbar, Music Map (button) and Playlist Tools
(button). And a collection of other small utilities and/or buttons (quicksearch, top tracks,
duplicates, device priority, etc.). All files have extensive comments and descriptions at the header
and all along the code, so you can check specific info about what everything does in its own file.

Every script has a github page with images, descriptions, etc. and updates must be get from there.

The root folder (with this readme) contains these scripts which can be loaded in any panel directly:

		- Load the file in any browser to use it.

The buttons folder (the one named 'buttons') contains buttons which can be be loaded by the toolbar file
named 'buttons_toolbar.js' as a parent host, so multiple scripts are loaded into a single panel in a
unified toolbar wih special UI related settings (see above):
	+ Playlist Tools:
		- .\buttons\buttons_playlist_tools.js (below 3 buttons require this one to be loaded too)
			- .\buttons\buttons_playlist_tools_macro_custom.js
			- .\buttons\buttons_playlist_tools_macros.js
			- .\buttons\buttons_playlist_tools_pool.js
			- .\buttons\buttons_playlist_tools_submenu_custom.js.js
	+ Music Map:
		- .\buttons\buttons_music_map_customizable.js (configurable with menus)

		- .\buttons\buttons_music_map_explorer.js
	+ Playlist manipulation:
		- .\buttons\buttons_playlist_remove_duplicates.js
		- .\buttons\buttons_playlist_filter.js
		- .\buttons\buttons_playlist_show_duplicates.js
		- .\buttons\buttons_playlist_history.js
	+ Output devices:

These buttons may be loaded as standalone scripts without problems but such configuration
is not supported. Only supported layout is loading them via the toolbar script
('buttons_toolbar.js'). The buttons folder contains multiple example files in case anyone
wants to create their own buttons using the existing framework.

The 'helpers' and 'main' folder contains common files used by most of the scripts. Don't touch
or load these alone. 'music_graph_descriptors_xxx.js', 'music_graph_descriptors_xxx_user.js'
and 'dyngenre_map_xxx.js' files, are related to 'Music Map' scripts. Look at those
files to understand what they do. Some users may want to add their own genres/styles at
'music_graph_descriptors_xxx_user.js', to do so a copy of the file must be placed at
(profile folder) '.\\js_data\\helpers\\' (this can be done with the customizable button).

The 'helpers-external' folder is another helper folder. Don't touch these. They are required to create
graphs within foobar or for html rendering. Read 'music_graph_descriptors_xxx.js' and check
'Draw Graph.html' in your browser (drag n drop) to see what they do.
