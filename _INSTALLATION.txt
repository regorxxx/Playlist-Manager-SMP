REQUISITES: (CHOOSE ONE)
-----------
Spider Monkey Panel 1.6.1 or greater (only stable releases supported):
https://theqwertiest.github.io/foo_spider_monkey_panel/

JSplitter 3.6.1.0 or greater (splitter + SMP x64 alternative)
https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php/topic,126743.0.html
https://foobar2000.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6378

Note SMP is only available as x32 release, but JSplitter supports both architectures.

ADDITIONAL REQUISITES: (INSTALL ALL)
----------------------
All my scripts require these fonts: Font Awesome 4, Segoe UI and Arial Unicode MS.
	- Font Awesome 4.ttf
	- Segoe UI.zip\Windows [XX]\seguisym.ttf
	- Arial Unicode MS.ttf

They can be found at: https://github.com/regorxxx/foobar2000-assets/tree/main/Fonts

WINE USERS:
-----------
All scripts try to use wine-friendly methods, focusing on config settings that can be changed via
menus or the UI panel, instead of using HTML (which only works on Windows), known working fonts, etc.

Please read this page and feel free to report (me) any problems with these scripts:
https://theqwertiest.github.io/foo_spider_monkey_panel/docs/faq/wine/

INSTALLATION AS PACKAGE:
------------------------
If the script is provided as package file, use the JSplitter\SMP 'Package Manager' to install it.
Press Shift + Win + R. click on the JSplitter\SMP panel to show the panel menu (note this combination
always work even if a script is already installed) and click on 'Configure panel...'. The package
manager can be found at the shown window. Look at the wiki for a guide. For ex:

https://github.com/regorxxx/Playlist-Manager-SMP/wiki/Installation#as-package-recommended

YOU CAN SKIP ANYTHING BELOW IN THAT CASE.

INSTALLATION AS FILE:
---------------------
Copy all files from the zip into a folder within foobar profile path. For ex: [profile]\xxx-scripts\
If there is no such path, create the required folder and copy the files there.

For ex: c:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\foobar2000\xxx-scripts\
For portable installations >= 1.6: ...\foobar2000\profile\xxx-scripts\  (*)
Multiple scripts may share some files (specially helpers) so overwrite if asked to do so.

Then load any script found on the root folder into a JSplitter\SMP panel within foobar ('File'
as script source). For example 'playlist_manager.js' or 'buttons_toolbar.js' files. Check 'INFO'
section (at '_SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.tx') for usage.

Some scripts may require additional files or dependencies (like fonts). Check the 'INFO' section
(at '_SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.tx') for more details, the github page or the related pdf documentation at
'readmes' folder (if available).

(*) If you upgraded to >1.6 from an older portable version then it may be possible that the ’profile’
folder does not exist. In such case you have to create it and move all the configuration folders/files
to it (ask for support at the forum in this case).

SMP 1.5.2+ WIN 11 BUG (crash loading scripts on portable installs):
-------------------------------------------------------------------
After loading a script into a panel, the panel may crash if foobar does not has the required [full]
access to the folder where the scripts reside. This may happen in portable installations since Win 11
restrict permissions to folders outside 'Program Files' or 'Users'. Ask at foobar forums for support.

SMP 1.5.2+ WINE BUG (crash when installing scripts):
----------------------------------------------------
After loading a script into a panel, Foobar2000 may crash (not only the panel). See below.
There have been no reports about this bug being present on JSplitter.

SMP 1.5.2+ BUG (crash when installing scripts):
-----------------------------------------------
After properly installing the files, if Foobar2000 SMP panels keep crashing due to 'missing files',
check '_switchPaths.zip'. Follow its instructions to fix it. Then report it at
https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php?topic=116669.0
There have been no reports about this bug being present on JSplitter.
