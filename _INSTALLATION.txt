REQUISITES: (CHOOSE ONE)
-----------
Spider Monkey Panel 1.6.1 or greater (only stable releases supported):
https://theqwertiest.github.io/foo_spider_monkey_panel/

JSplitter 3.6.1.0 or greater (splitter + SMP x64 alternative)
https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php/topic,126743.0.html
https://foobar2000.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6378

Note SMP is only available as x32 release, but JSplitter supports both architectures.

WINE USERS:
-----------
All scripts try to use wine-friendly methods, focusing on config settings that can be changed via
menus or the UI panel, instead of using HTML (which only works on Windows), known working fonts, etc.

Please read this page and feel free to report (me) any problems with these scripts:
https://theqwertiest.github.io/foo_spider_monkey_panel/docs/faq/wine/

INSTALLATION AS PACKAGE:
------------------------
If the script is provided as package file, use the JSplitter\SMP 'Package Manager' to install it.
Press Shift + Win + R. click on the JSplitter\SMP panel to show the panel menu (note this combination
always work even if a script is already installed) and click on 'Configure panel...'. The package
manager can be found at the shown window. Look at the wiki for a guide. For ex:

https://github.com/regorxxx/Playlist-Manager-SMP/wiki/Installation#as-package-recommended

YOU CAN SKIP ANYTHING BELOW IN THAT CASE.

INSTALLATION AS FILE:
---------------------
Copy all files from the zip into YOUR_FOOBAR_PROFILE_PATH\scripts\SMP\xxx-scripts
If there is no such path, create all the required folders and subfolders on it.
Any other path WILL NOT work without editing the scripts. (see images\_Installation_*jpg) (*)
For ex: mine is 			c:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\foobar2000\scripts\SMP\xxx-scripts\...
For portable installations >= 1.6: .\foobar2000\profile\scripts\SMP\xxx-scripts\...  (**)
For portable installations <= 1.5: .\foobar2000\scripts\SMP\xxx-scripts\...
Multiple scripts may share some files (specially helpers) so overwrite if asked to do so.

Then load any script found on the root folder into a JSplitter\SMP panel within foobar ('File'
as script source). For example 'playlist_manager.js' or 'buttons_toolbar.js' files. Check 'INFO'
section (at '_SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.tx') for usage.

Some scripts may require additional files or dependencies (like fonts). Check the 'INFO' section
(at '_SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.tx') for more details, the github page or the related pdf documentation at
'readmes' folder (if available).

(*) To change the hardcoded installation part of the path, go to .\helpers\helpers_xxx.js
and change the variable named 'folders.xxxName'. This is a workaround for some JSplitter\SMP
limitations when working with relative paths. Its use is at your own responsibility but feel free
to report any problem with it.

(**) If you upgraded to >1.6 from an older portable version then it may be possible that the 'profile'
folder does not exist. In such case you have to create it and move all the config folders/files to it,
where they should reside (instead of the root of the foobar2000 installation path). Some native folders
and files which must be moved include:
	index-data, js_data, component-updates, configuration, crash reports, user-components,
	foo_spider_monkey_panel, library, playlists, theme.fth, LargeFieldsConfig.txt, version.txt
Some extra folders from other components which must be moved include (non extensive list):
	autobackup, dvda_metabase, foo_httpcontrol_data, foo_youtube, images, lastfm, python, sacd_metabase,
	vst-presets, yttm,minibar.db, playlist-tree-0.pts, playlist-tree-1.pts,
If you don't move all the config folders/files then on startup default values will be used for things
not found, probably "losing" the theme or other config. You may "fix" it later moving the missing files
which still reside in the root. May take some tries to do them all.

SMP 1.5.2+ WINE BUG (crash when installing scripts):
----------------------------------------------------
After loading a script into a panel, Foobar2000 may crash (not only the panel). See below.
There have been no reports about this bug being present on JSplitter.

SMP 1.5.2+ BUG (crash when installing scripts):
-----------------------------------------------
After properly installing the files, if Foobar2000 SMP panels keep crashing due to 'missing files',
check '_switchPaths.zip'. Follow its instructions to fix it. Then report it at
https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php?topic=116669.0
There have been no reports about this bug being present on JSplitter.
