If you need more info about the JS-hosts check the wiki of this script or ask at HA forums to their component authors.

ADDITIONAL REQUISITES: (INSTALL ALL)
----------------------
All my scripts require these fonts: Font Awesome 4, Segoe UI and Arial Unicode MS.
	- Font Awesome 4.ttf
	- Segoe UI.zip\Windows [XX]\seguisym.ttf
	- Arial Unicode MS.ttf

They can be found at: https://github.com/regorxxx/foobar2000-assets/tree/main/Fonts

INSTALLATION AS PACKAGE:
------------------------
Your download should have a file named like '*-SMP-*-*-*-package.zip' which contains this txt file inside. You have
to load shuch package file as is into your JS-Host. If you have unzipped the package at a random location and
trying to load any js file inside... then you are doing it wrong :)

Use the JSplitter\SMP 'Package Manager' to install it. Press Shift + Win + R. click on the JSplitter\SMP panel
to show the panel menu (note this combination always work even if a script is already installed) and click on
'Configure panel...'. The package manager can be found at the shown window.

Click on 'Import' and load the package zip file previously downloaded. Look at the wiki if you need more help.

WINE USERS:
-----------
All scripts try to use wine-friendly methods, focusing on config settings that can be changed via
menus or the UI panel, instead of using HTML (which only works on Windows), known working fonts, etc.

Please read this page and feel free to report (me) any problems with these scripts:
