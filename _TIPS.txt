PORTABLE TIP:
-------------
Some scripts have configurable paths to save databases, track playlists, etc. Those can be found on
the properties panel. Instead of using the menus and adding an absolute path, it would be advisable
to edit them manually to ensure they are relative too:
For ex. for the playlist manager, the tracked folder:
H:\MySoftware\foobar2000\profile\playlist_manager\	--> .\profile\playlist_manager\	(>= 1.6:)
													--> .\playlist_manager\			(<= 1.5:)

When an script is being loaded within a portable installation, it will set the default paths using
relative paths. It will also warn with popups and/or the console about the -non recommended- use of
absolute paths on portable installations. If you are using a portable installation on fixed discs with
absolute paths on panels it has no repercussion, but it becomes a problem as soon as you use it in a
removable device (whose disk letter changes). The configured paths would look for a disk letter which
would be different every time.

FOO_JESUS TIP:
-------------
If using Autosave & Autobackup component (https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_jesus) it's
recommended to add 'js_data' and 'playlist_manager' folders at
'Preferences\Advanced\Autosave & Autobackup\Files and directories to backup (...)'.
'js_data' contains config json data for most of these scripts, while 'playlist_manager' folder is the
default folder to save playlists files for the playlist manager (*).

Note the same tip applies if using the JSplitter\SMP script replacement Autobackup-SMP:
https://regorxxx.github.io/foobar2000-SMP.github.io/scripts/autobackup-smp/

(*) When the default path is changed or when using multiple playlist manager panels (and thus different
paths), don't forget to add them to Autosave config too. There is a limit though, paths outside the
profile folder can not be autosaved by the component. That happens when tracking a playlist folder at
the place where the music resides (for relative paths playlist usage), network locations, etc. In some
cases this limitation can be bypassed by creating a SymLink at the profile folder to the external path.
For ex: C:\Foobar2000\profile\my_external_folder\ -> symlink -> H:\Music\

Presets TIP:
-------------
There are multiple useful presets for components, the UI or these JSplitter\SMP scripts at the folder
named 'Presets'. Further documentation can be found there. Some of them are meant to be loaded
automatically (recipes and themes for Music Map) to then be set at buttons, others are meant
to be loaded on demand to modify the panel behavior (Playlist Tools). Masstagger presets can be loaded
at its panel, while UI TF scripts are meant to be used at different places of UI config (columns,
library view, etc.) if desired. In both cases their use is in line with these SMP scripts, so they make
it easier to tag or visualize most commonly used tags, variables, etc. (for ex. a CUI script which
displays keys in Camelot Wheel notation with colors).
	- AutoHotkey: for world map script automatic tagging
	- Masstagger: general tagging scripts which may be useful
	- Network: for playlist manager script and network drives without recycle bin
	- Notepad++: to highligh picard code on notepad++
	- Picard: to be used on picard as tagging scripts
	- Playlist Tools: presets (menu entries) which can be added to the script
	- Music Map: presets (menu entries) which are loaded on the fly on the custom button
	- UI: multiple UI scripts
		- DUI
		- CUI
	- World Map: pre-filled database with artist/country tags
