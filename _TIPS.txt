PORTABLE TIP:
-------------
Some scripts have configurable paths to save databases, track playlists, etc. Those can be found on
the properties panel. Instead of using the menus and adding an absolute path, it would be advisable
to edit them manually to ensure they are relative too:
For ex. for the playlist manager, the tracked folder:
H:\MySoftware\foobar2000\profile\playlist_manager\	--> .\profile\playlist_manager\	(>= 1.6:)
							--> .\playlist_manager\		(<= 1.5:)

When an script finds it's being loaded within a portable installation, will set the default paths using
relative paths. It will also warn with popups and/or the console about the -non recommended- use of
absolute paths on portable installations. If you are using a portable installation on fixed discs with
absolute paths on panels it has no repercussion, but it becomes a problem as soon as you use it in a
removable device (whose disk letter changes). The configured paths would look for a disk letter which
would be different every time.

FOO_JESUS TIP:
-------------
If using Autosave & Autobackup component (https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_jesus) it's
recommended to add 'js_data' and 'playlist_manager' folders at
'Preferences\Advanced\Autosave & Autobackup\Files and directories to backup (...)'.
'js_data' contains config json data for most of these scripts, while 'playlist_manager' folder is the
default folder to save playlists files for the playlist manager (*).

Note the same tip applies if using the SMP script replacement Autobackup-SMP: 
https://regorxxx.github.io/foobar2000-SMP.github.io/scripts/autobackup-smp/

(*) When the default path is changed or when using multiple playlist manager panels (and thus different
paths), don't forget to add them to Autosave config too. There is a limit though, paths outside the
profile folder can not be autosaved by the component. That happens when tracking a playlist folder at
the place where the music resides (for relative paths playlist usage), network locations, etc. In some
cases this limitation can be bypassed by creating a SymLink at the profile folder to the external path.
For ex: C:\Foobar2000\profile\my_external_folder\ -> symlink -> H:\Music\

Presets TIP:
-------------
There are multiple useful presets for components, the UI or these SMP scripts at the folder named
'Presets'. Further documentation can be found there. Some of them are meant to be loaded automatically
(recipes and themes for Search By Distance) to then be set at buttons, others are meant to be loaded 
on demand to modify the panel behavior (Playlist Tools). Masstagger presets can be loaded at its panel,
while UI TF scripts are meant to be used at different places of UI config (columns, library view, etc.)
if desired. In both cases their use is in line with these SMP scripts, so they make it easier to tag or
visualize most commonly used tags, variables, etc. (for ex. a CUI script which displays keys in Camelot
Wheel notation with colors).
	- AutoHotkey: for world map script automatic tagging
	- Masstagger: general tagging scripts which may be useful
	- Network: for playlist manager script and network drives without recycle bin
	- Notepad++: to highligh picard code on notepad++
	- Picard: to be used on picard as tagging scripts
	- Playlist Tools: presets (menu entries) which can be added to the script
	- Search by [distance]: presets (menu entries) which are loaded on the fly on the custom button
	- UI: multiple UI scripts
		- DUI
		- CUI
	- World Map: pre-filled database with artist/country tags

INFO:
-----
This is general info for all the scripts. Within all files you will find 6 [+] big scripts: Playlist
Manager, Timeline, World Map, Not a Waveform Seekbar, Search by Distance (button) and Playlist Tools
(button). And a collection of other small utilities and/or buttons (quicksearch, top tracks,
duplicates, device priority, etc.). All files have extensive comments and descriptions at the header
and all along the code, so you can check specific info about what everything does in its own file.

Every script has a github page with images, descriptions, etc. and updates must be get from there.

The root folder (with this readme) contains these scripts which can be loaded in any panel directly:

These buttons may be loaded as standalone scripts without problems but such configuration
is not supported. Only loading them via the toolbar script. The buttons folder contains multiple
example files in case anyone wants to create their own buttons using the existing framework.

The 'helpers' and 'main' folder contains common files used by most of the scripts. Don't touch
or load these alone. 'music_graph_descriptors_xxx.js', 'music_graph_descriptors_xxx_user.js'
and 'dyngenre_map_xxx.js' files, are related to 'Search by Distance' scripts. Look at those
files to understand what they do. Some users may want to add their own genres/styles at
'music_graph_descriptors_xxx_user.js', to do so a copy of the file must be placed at
(profile folder) '.\\js_data\\helpers\\' (this can be done with the customizable button).

The 'helpers-external' folder is another helper folder. Don't touch these. They are required to create
graphs within foobar or for html rendering. Read 'music_graph_descriptors_xxx.js' and check
'Draw Graph.html' in your browser (drag n drop) to see what they do.
